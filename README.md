# GERM-N-Engineering

Hi! Welcome to Team GERM&N’s open source software for Simon- our low cost Socially Assistive Robot (SAR)!

We currently have open-source code that allows for:
	fine motor control;
	facial tracking with Raspberry Pi and Python’s OpenCV file;
	and natural language processing.


If you want to learn more about what we are doing or have any questions- check us out our website!
